# Chatter

### Work in progress


Full stack real time one-on-one chat application. Main goal is to practice web sockets and user authentication with Spring Boot and React.

## How to run the app
<a href="https://chatter.icysand-3b71e0c3.northeurope.azurecontainerapps.io"> Try now!</a> App is running live on Microsoft Azure. (Launching might take some time if app is sleeping, please allow some time for server to wake up as well, I had to scale replicas down to 0 to avoid unnecessary costs)

## Demo
You can create a couple of accounts and try the chat features yourself (use incognito mode or 2 different browsers to login with multiple users) or search for 'otto' and send me a message!
At the moment the app only matches username search to exact matches, so keep in mind that it is case-sensitive and doesn't auto-fill suggestions.

## Key Features
- Strong user authentication and authorization
- Real-time messaging with other users
- See when other users are typing a message for you
- User search only matches perfect usernames

## Pictures coming soon
